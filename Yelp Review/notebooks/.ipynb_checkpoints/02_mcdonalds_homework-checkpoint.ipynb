    "    - In other words, X should be defined using either **all rows** or **only those rows with a confidence_mean of 1**, whichever produced a better AUC above.\n",
    "    - X should refer to either the **review column** or the **review_city column**, whichever produced a better AUC above.\n",

There are a few helpers taking your orders throughout the drive-thru route and they are the worst. They rush you in placing an order and gets impatient once the order gets a tad bit complicated.  Don't even bother changing your mind oh NO! They will glare at you and snap at you if you want to change something.  I understand its FAST food, but I want my order placed right.  Not going back if I can help it.   \n",

The store claimed to be 24 hours and the manager was standing right there doing paper work but would not help us. The cashier was only concerned with doing things for the drive thru and said that the manager said he wasn't allowed to help us. We thought it was a joke at first but when realized it wasn't we said goodbye and they just let us leave. I work in a restaurant and this is by far the worst service I have ever seen. I know it was late and maybe they didn't want to be there but it was completely ridiculous. I think the manager should be fired.   \n",

Even though it is still fast food, the service at the drive-thru is the best. They rarely make a mistake and I never see anyone parked in the drive-thru slots where they bring food out because they don't have it ready. So, if you like McDonald's fast food, it doesn't get any better than this.   \n",
